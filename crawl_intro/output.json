In VC, Priya invests at the intersection of sports and health, championing precision health through a gender lens as the key to unlocking enhanced female athlete performance. \n\nBy background and training, Priya is a seasoned structured finance and derivatives lawyer, having attained of-counsel status at Clifford Chance in 2010. As a pioneer in the Middle East derivatives market, she was a key architect of the ISDA-IIFM Tahawut Master Agreement, now the cornerstone of a $3.2 trillion industry.
